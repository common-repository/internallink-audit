## INTERNAL LINKS REPORTING
Does your content have anything missing? Is there any content that has no internal links? These are called orphan pages/posts.

With InternalLink Audit you can quickly see which pages have very few or no internal links pointing to them.

In addition to the outgoing internal links to a particular post, the audit reports page also shows how many incoming internal links are coming from the entire website.

Want to process more than 50 articles?  In InternalLink Audit Premium your entire site will get scanned to find all internal links along with a filter option which will ignore specific url structure like affiliation redirection links.
